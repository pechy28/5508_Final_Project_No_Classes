# 5508_Final_Project_No_Classes
My final project for DIG 5508

NOTES:
---------------------
This project works best in the p5.js web editor, but any will work so long as you have p5.play added to your editor.

CONTROLS:
----------------------
Left Arrow: Go Left
Right Arrow: Go Right
Up Arrow: Jump


DIRECTIONS:
---------------------
Collect the keys through the level, and avoid the skull guards. Once you have collected a key, go to the door. You cannot pass through this door without a key. Going through the door takes you to the next level. Make it through three levels to win!


STORY:
---------------------
You have been thrown into the town's dungeon after false acustations. Luckily for you, the guards aren't that great at keeping their keys with them, so you can collect them and escape on your own. Can you make it out alive?
